    "Historical stock prices are used to predict the direction of future stock prices. The\r\n",
    "developed stock price prediction model uses a novel two-layer reasoning approach that\r\n",
    "employs domain knowledge from technical analysis in the first layer of reasoning to guide\r\n",
    "a second layer of reasoning based on machine learning. The model is supplemented by a\r\n",

    "model to determine the amount of capital to invest on future predictions. Based on a\r\n",
    "number of portfolio simulations with trade signals generated by the model, we conclude\r\n",

    "predicting shifts in supply and demand (Turner, 2007). As mentioned earlier, shifts in\r\n",
    "supply and demand is the basis of most economic and fundamental forecasting. If there\r\n",
    "are more sellers than buyers for a stock (i.e., increased supply), the theory states that\r\n",
    "the price should fall, and similarly, if there are more buyers than sellers (i.e., increased\r\n",
    "demand) the price should rise. Given the ability to foresee these shifts in supply and\r\n",
    "demand thus gives the trader the ability to establish profitable entry and exit positions,\r\n",
    "which is the ultimate goal of stock analysis.\r\n",
